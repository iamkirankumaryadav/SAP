# SAP RAP (ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model)
- A powerful framework within the ABAP Cloud that revolutionizes the way you build business applications and services.
- It provides a standardized approach for developing cloud-ready, scalable, and user-friendly applications.

### Key Components of SAP RAP
1. **Core Data Services (CDS):** 
- CDS is the foundation of RAP, allowing you to define semantically rich data models that encapsulate the business logic and data structures of your application.

3. **Business Services:** 
- Business services provide a layer of abstraction over your data models, encapsulating complex business logic and exposing it as reusable services.

4. **SAPUI5-based User Interfaces:** 
- RAP supports the creation of modern, responsive, and user-friendly user interfaces using SAPUI5, the leading UI framework for SAP applications.
