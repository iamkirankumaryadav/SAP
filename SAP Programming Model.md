# SAP Programming Models
- SAP offers various programming models to cater to different development needs, from simple customizations to complex application development.

### 1. **ABAP Programming**
- **Classic ABAP:** The traditional programming language for SAP development, used for customizing and extending SAP applications. It involves working with data dictionaries, reports, forms, and function modules.
- **ABAP Objects:** An object-oriented extension of Classic ABAP, providing features like classes, interfaces, and inheritance. It's used for building complex and reusable components.

### 2. **Web Dynpro ABAP**
- A framework for developing web-based user interfaces for SAP applications.
- Allows developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications.
- Provides a component-based approach to UI development.

### Choosing the Right Model
- **Complexity of the task:** Simple customizations may require Classic ABAP, while complex applications may benefit from ABAP Objects or UI5/Fiori.
- **Target platform:** Web-based applications can be built using Web Dynpro ABAP or UI5/Fiori.
- **Performance requirements:** HANA's in-memory capabilities can be leveraged for high-performance analytics.
- **Integration with other systems:** Cloud Platform offers integration capabilities with various systems.
